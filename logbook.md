Week 1:
- I found the Starbucks menu assignment to be a good refresher on basic HTML. I also learned about description lists for the first time.
    - I spent approximately 20 minutes doing the assignment and some additional time setting up a Git repo for this class
    - This assignment used HTML
    - I wrote a total of 79 lines of code
- Outside of this class I did coding for CS-115, SSW-564, and Software Engineering Club
