# Software Engineering Logbook

<!-- Do a weekly log of your experience.  It should include:

reflections on assignments and your own productivity
Homework stats:
time spent on each assignment
language used
lines of code produced
Describe any coding outside of class -->

Week 1:
- I found the Starbucks menu assignment to be a good refresher on basic HTML. I also learned about description lists for the first time
    - I spent approximately 20 minutes doing the assignment and some additional time setting up a Git repo for this class
    - This assignment used HTML
    - I wrote a total of 79 lines of code
- Outside of this class I did coding for CS-115, SSW-567, and Software Engineering Club

Week 2:
- I found homework #2 to be a good introduction to CSS and how it can be used with HTML. This was a good way to learn about external stylesheets as well as HTML classes and IDs
    - I spent approximately 30 minutes doing this assignment
    - This assignment mainly involved CSS but there was some modification of the HTML done as well
    - I wrote 37 lines of CSS and modified a few lines of HTML
- Outside of this class I did coding for CS-115 and SSW-567

Week 3:
- I found homework #3 to be a good introduction to CSS and how it can be used with HTML. This was a good way to learn about external stylesheets as well as HTML classes and IDs
    - I spent approximately 30 minutes doing this assignment
    - This assignment mainly involved CSS but there was some modification of the HTML done as well
    - I wrote 37 lines of CSS and modified a few lines of HTML
- Outside of this class I did coding for CS-115 and SSW-567

Week 4:
- I found homework #4 to be a good first introduction to basic javaScript. It helped me to understand how JS can interact with the HTML DOM. However I think the assignment could have gone deeper into the JS functions we learned about in class
    - I spent approximately 20 minutes doing this assignment
    - This assignment was completed in JavaScript but required modifying some HTML as well
    - I wrote approximately 30 lines of JavaScript and modified a few lines of HTML
- Outside of this class I did homework assignments and labs for CS-115 and SSW-567

Week 5:
- Homework #5 - Simple Webpage for Food Restaurant - was a good recap of the web development tools we learned about already in class. It was helpful to bring these tools together and get to go in my own direction while completing this project. However, I did find the requirements to be vague and not very reflective of what the real requirements for a restaurant webpage would be
    - I spent approximately one hour doing this assignment
    - This assignment used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    - I wrote a total of 125 lines of code for this project
- I also took some time this week to install the Stevens VPN and connect to the Mallard server. I used some basic linux commands to navigate around and change my password
- Outside of this class I did homework assignments and labs for CS-115 and SSW-567
